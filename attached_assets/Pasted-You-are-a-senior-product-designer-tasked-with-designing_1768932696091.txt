You are a senior product designer tasked with designing the UX for an AI mobility agent, inspired deeply by the principles of *侘寂美學 (Wabi-Sabi)* as articulated in the Silphium Design philosophy. This is not a minimal clone of a standard template — it must embody a calm, organic, human-centric, and emotionally resonant experience that reflects these Wabi-Sabi principles:

- **Kanso (Simplicity):** Only the essential elements should be present; generous use of negative space (Ma) to calm and focus the user. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Fukinsei (Asymmetry / Organic Balance):** The layout should avoid rigid symmetry; slight offsets and natural balance feel more alive than grids. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Shibui (Quiet, Subtle Beauty):** Avoid loud, flashy design; use muted colors and subtle motion that reward deeper observation. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Shizen (Naturalness):** Use organic shapes, earthy tones, and tactile textures to evoke natural materials even in digital UI. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Yūgen (Subtle Depth):** Reveal meaning gradually; let small nuances invite further engagement rather than shouting information. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Datsuzoku (Freedom from Convention):** Break standard UI conventions thoughtfully where it improves human experience — not for novelty, but to feel alive. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Seijaku (Tranquility):** Create stillness through spacing, gentle pacing, and thoughtful interactions. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

### DESIGN DIRECTIVES (High-Priority)

**1) Home / Intent Screen**  
Focus on **Kanso** and **Seijaku**:
- Clean, uncluttered view with generous negative space.  
- Only the essential — destination input and a tiny, subdued 💬 button for optional user notes.  
- Avoid heavy lines, boxes, or borders that divide the space rigidly.  
- Layout should be slightly **off-center** (Fukinsei), e.g., the search input subtly shifted slightly left of center for organic balance.

**2) Colors & Textures**  
Apply **Shibui** and **Shizen**:
- Earthy, muted palette (soft beiges, misty grays, muted greens).  
- Introduce extremely subtle background texture (e.g., light paper grain) so full white is never flat or harsh.  
- Avoid high-contrast blacks and whites.  

**3) Typography & Elements**  
Reflect **Kanso** with humanist text:
- Use a warm, humanist sans typeface (or gentle serif if it feels more tactile).  
- Very generous line spacing; avoid condensed typography.  
- Slightly imperfect iconography (hand-drawn or organic stroke).  

**4) Spatial Composition**  
Embed **Fukinsei** and **Seijaku** in layout:
- Headers, inputs, and controls should have generous padding and not adhere to rigid grid lines.  
- Slight offsets — e.g., buttons not perfectly aligned on the same axis — to create a natural rhythm.

**5) Motion & Interaction**  
Use **Yūgen**:
- Very subtle fade-in and easing animations rather than sharp transitions.  
- Fractional motion that feels like breathing, not abrupt.  

**6) Microcopy & Tone**  
Match the aesthetic:
- Use humble, respectful, and human language.  
- Avoid technical or hard commands; favor *invitation* language.  
- E.g., “Anything I should know?” for the note button, not “Add prompt.”

### FEATURE SPECIFIC UX BEHAVIORS

**A) Destination Input with Subtle 💬 Note Button**  
- The input card should feel calm and organic — soft shape, tactile shadow, imperfect curvature.  
- The 💬 button should be muted, small, and slightly off-aligned to the right side to signal optionality and human-centric design.

**B) Progressive Disclosure**  
- Only after destination entry, gently reveal further controls (unfamiliar toggle, sliders for calm vs fast, budget mode).  
- Reveal controls via subtle, natural motion (not rigid expand/collapse).

**C) Unexpected but Purposeful Asymmetry**  
In layout, occasionally break symmetry to feel alive, not template-like — e.g. slightly offset the slider track or the footer text so it feels human, not machined.

### DELIVERABLES

Produce high-fidelity screens for:
1. **Home / Intent Screen** (with organic asymmetry and note button)  
2. **Destination Entered State** (progressive reveal, gentle hierarchy)  
3. **Decision Preview Panel** (quiet, subtle guidance)  
4. **Execution Guidance** (calm step-based UI)  

Include a style system that defines:
- Muted color palette  
- Subtle textures  
- Humanist typography scale  
- Organic spacing rules  
- Interaction motion tokens  

Design these not as a “template” but as a *living, human UX* that embraces imperfection, slow pace, and attentive calm.

Refer explicitly to the Wabi-Sabi principles: Kanso, Fukinsei, Shibui, Shizen, Yūgen, Datsuzoku, and Seijaku throughout the design.
